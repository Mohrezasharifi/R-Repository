# TOOLS USED:
PowerBI 
* R for the data cleaning and analysis.
* Install the PowerBI on your system to make use of this project.

The file 'DataVisualization_FinalProject' contains the project file.
The file 'Datafile_245.csv' contains the dataset used for the project.
# DETAILS: 
Non-technical people and the decision makers who may not have statistical knowledge, they tend to focus more on the numbers and that's what I tried to focus throughout my work.
To illustrate the spread of the virus, I tried to use the statistical methods to showcase those numbers boldly.
