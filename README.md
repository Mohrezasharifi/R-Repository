# TOOLS USED:

* R for the data cleaning and analysis.
* Logistic Regression for classification into two classes (Begnin and Malignant)

# DETAILS: 
Non-technical people and the decision makers who may not have statistical knowledge, they tend to focus more on the numbers and that's what I tried to focus throughout my work.
To illustrate work, I tried to use the statistical methods to showcase those numbers boldly.
